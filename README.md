### About me :wave:
Hi, my name is Victor, but you can call me David. Since the beginning of 2024, I have been dedicated to studying and practicing to become a Software QA Engineer. Transitioning from nearly a decade of experience in accounting, I have developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking, data integrity, and attention to detailâ€”skills that seamlessly translate to the meticulous nature of QA work. My background in accounting taught me to be deadline-oriented and thorough in my work, which are essential qualities in software testing. I have completed a comprehensive Software Testing and Quality Assurance certification course, and I am passionate about ensuring the quality and reliability of software products. In the QA position, I see the potential to make the digital world more welcoming for every person. I am determined to continue growing in this field and have also started learning test automation and delving deeper into Python to further enhance my skills.

### My experience :office:
My journey into software QA began with a role as a Junior Quality Assurance Engineer at Zan, Inc., where I made significant strides in both technical and soft skills. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure the flawless performance of products, conducted meticulous testing, and developed test automation know-how. My accounting background provided me with a unique perspective on QA, as I was accustomed to overseeing the correct operation of internal systems and reporting any discrepancies. At Orchestra, I further honed my skills by collaborating with teams to identify defects in web applications, using tools like TestRail and Jira. I have demonstrated proficiency in executing test cases, debugging, and providing detailed documentation. My determination to excel in QA is driven by a commitment to improving the user experience and ensuring high-quality software products.
